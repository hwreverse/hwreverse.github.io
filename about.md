aka **hwreverse** aka *HardWare Release Zero* (= Prototype)

Lecturer / Research fellow at BMSTU - Baumann Moscow State Technical University

Big Fan of **Vintage Basic Pocket Computer ポケコン** (=pokekon) from the 80ties and 90ties (Sharp, Casio,...)

My [Collection](https://github.com/hwreverse/PocketComputerTools/blob/master/img/collection.jpg/). is quite extensive, because there are nothing better to teach young minds proper low resource programming as well as Processor Architecture when you have just 1k-32k RAM Program memory free !
Z80 Computers with SRAM had a fully static design, interrupt them and read out every state of every pin in the system. Ideal for teaching processors.
