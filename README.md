# HWR0

aka **hwreverse** aka *HardWare Release Zero* (= Prototype)

Lecturer / Research fellow at BMSTU - Baumann Moscow State Technical University

Big Fan of **Vintage Basic Pocket Computer ポケコン** (=pokekon) from the 80ties and 90ties (Sharp, Casio,...)

My [Collection](https://github.com/hwreverse/PocketComputerTools/blob/master/img/collection.jpg/). is quite extensive, because there are nothing better to teach young minds proper low resource programming as well as Processor Architecture when you have just 1k-32k RAM Program memory free !
Z80 Computers with SRAM had a fully static design, interrupt them and read out every state of every pin in the system. Ideal for teaching processors.

## My Mission

To preserve knowledge about Vintage Pocket Computers who ae not fabricated any more as long as possible by collecting every bit of technical information and creating open-source electronics to interface yourself with these devices / create hardware extensions to them with maximum ease, so that more people are inclined to still work with them. 

The more people still use them, the farther away we move the date of their complete extinction from the minds!

## What you can find here

I publish various [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) Projects of electronic circuits & their PCBs for working with Pocket Computers. Sometimes, Projects are even ready to be produced & assembled by a PCBA service of your choosing. For these small and cheap project, I tend to work with [JLCPCB's](https://jlcpcb.com/) PCBA Service. Try it out !

I update these Repositories in my small leisure time, as soon as I test **AND** validate a new design.

### USB-to-Serial Interfaces to connect Pocket Computers to your PC :

### Sound Cards :

- [hwreverse / PokeConSound](https://github.com/hwreverse/PokeConSound)

### Differents bits of code 

- BMP to HEX Converter, Grayscale to ASM Code Converter (to show Bitmaps in B/W or Grayscale on a Pocket Computer Screen)<BR> [hwreverse / PocketComputerTools](https://github.com/hwreverse/PocketComputerTools)

### What Pocket Computers are we talking about ?

- **Sharp PC-G800** * Series = G850V /VS / S 
- **Sharp PC-E500** Series = E500 /E550 / E600
- **Sharp PC-1600/K** of course

- **Casio PB-1000** /C / PB-2000C / AI-1000
- **Casio FX-800** * Series (VX-1 to VX-4)
- **Casio FX-890P aka Z / Z-1** (the first 16 bit from Casio !)

- **TRS-80 Model 100 + Model 200** - While not a *"Pocket"* Computer, still a great system to program and to build extensions for (it is really easy)
